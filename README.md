## Hi there, I'm Paul ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working remotely, currently at Thoughtworks ðŸ˜Ž

### A little bit about me

I focus on cloud-scale web applications running on Kubernetes, and I have worked primarily with .NET, SQL, TypeScript and React.

I'm tech agnostic and love programming languages, especially functional ones. I believe learning FP has fundamentally changed the way I write code, even object-oriented code, and it has helped me better understand the relationship between behavior and state.

My current favorite technologies are:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Effect for TypeScript](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect)
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org)

[Gleam](https://gleam.run/) is also catching my interest, but I haven't found time to try it yet.
