## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul, a software engineer working remote, currently at Thoughtworks.

My focus is on fullstack business applications. I strive to be an [expert generalist](https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html).

I am a big fan of functional programming and functional programming languages (but also OOP, if it's written correctly).

Some of my favorite tools and languages:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Effect for TypeScript](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect)
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org)
- [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)
