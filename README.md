# Hello!

I’m Paul, a Software Engineer and Consultant at Thoughtworks, where I partner with clients to design and deliver full-stack cloud-native applications and solutions.

I have a diverse toolset—from .NET, SQL, Docker, Kubernetes, TypeScript, and React to C#, F#, Rust, and beyond. I also have a particular love for functional programming, in a pragmatic sense, favoring F# or OCaml, but also Rust, Gleam and Elixir (though I've not written production code in all these yet).

I try hard to be an [expert-generalist](https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html) instead of focusing on one thing or a small set of things, such a technology, an industry, a programming language or a paradigm.
